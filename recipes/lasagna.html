            <h5>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</h5>
            In a large skillet, brown the ground beef or sausage over medium heat. Drain any excess fat.
            Add the chopped onion and garlic. Cook until the onion is translucent.

            <h5>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</h5>
            In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Mix

            <h5>Cook the Lasagna Noodles:</h5>
            If using regular noodles, cook according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside. If
            using
            no-boil noodles, you can skip this step.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h5>Assemble the Lasagna:</h5>
            Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
            Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
            Layer 3 lasagna noodles over the sauce.
            Spread half of the cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce.
            Repeat the layers: noodles, cheese mixture, meat sauce.
            Top with the remaining noodles, meat sauce, and sprinkle extra mozzarella cheese on top.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Bake:</h5>
            Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent sticking, you can spray the foil with cooking spray).
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
            Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.
            Cool and Serve:

            <b>Let the lasagna cool</b> for about 10-15 minutes before slicing. This will help the layers hold together.
            Serve hot, garnished with fresh basil if desired.
