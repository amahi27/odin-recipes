            <h5>Cook the Pasta:</h5>

            <h5>Sauté the Mushrooms:</h5>

            In a large skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the
            sliced

            skillet and set aside.

            fragrant.
            Add the shrimp, season with salt and black pepper, and cook until they turn pink and opaque, about 2-3
            minutes

            Return the drained pasta to the skillet with the shrimp and garlic. Add the sautéed mushrooms and toss to
            combine.
            Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, stirring rapidly to
            create a creamy sauce. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time until you reach your desired consistency.
